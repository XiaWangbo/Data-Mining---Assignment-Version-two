# Data-Mining---Assignment-Version-two

Method for running the project

cnn_model.py: This file contains the CNN model architecture used for digit recognition.

train.py: This file is used to train the CNN model on the MNIST dataset and save the trained model.

main.py: This file is the main application that allows the user to draw digits and get predictions using the trained model.

If you would like to run this project, the file named train.py must be run first, in order to train the model. And then, you are able to run the file named main.py after successful trainning. 

Alternatively, you do not need to train it becasue I have already completed the trainning process (See the file called trained_model.pt)
